Podman provides native integration with SystemD, allowing you to manage containers as system services. While Podman Compose doesn't directly support this, you can generate SystemD unit files for your Compose services:

podman generate systemd --files --name myapp


mv *.service /etc/systemd/system/


systemctl enable myapp
systemctl start myapp
