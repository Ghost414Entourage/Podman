Podman supports multiple storage drivers, each with its own characteristics: 

overlay: The default and recommended driver. It uses a union filesystem to efficiently layer container images. 

vfs: A simple driver that copies entire filesystems. It's slower but works on any filesystem. 

devicemapper: Uses thin provisioning and copy-on-write snapshots. It's being phased out in favor of overlay.

Podman stores images and containers in specific locations based on the user mode: 

Root Mode: /var/lib/containers

Rootless Mode: $HOME/.local/share/containers






storage/: Contains image layers and container filesystems. 

libpod/: Stores container configuration files.


podman volume create my_volume

podman run -v my_volume:/data ubuntu


podman run -v /host/path:/container/path ubuntu

podman volume prune





Podman's storage can be configured through the storage.conf file:

System-wide: /etc/containers/storage.conf 

User-specific: $HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf





Key configuration options include:

driver: Set the storage driver. 

graphroot: Specify the root directory for container storage. 

runroot: Set the directory for runtime state.

driver = "overlay"
graphroot = "/var/lib/containers/storage"
runroot = "/run/containers/storage"
